# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->


## 0.1.3

### New Features

- Remove stitching artefacts only implemented for black pixels ([#31](https://github.com/Defense-Circuits-Lab/findmycells/issues/31))
  - ToDo: Option to specify whether artefact pixel color is black or white

### Bugs Squashed

- czi-file shape behaves differently across different imaging conditions ([#28](https://github.com/Defense-Circuits-Lab/findmycells/issues/28))
  - Depending on whether you acquired czi-files with more than one z-plane, more than one channel, more than one image version and so on, the czifile module returns image data in different shape. Taking care of the different possibilities, can be achieved by the following solution (in case there are more conditions, that are not handled here, more elif loops can be added):

Solution:
in readers/microscopy_images.py:

- make unzipped folders containing .roi files usable! ([#24](https://github.com/Defense-Circuits-Lab/findmycells/issues/24))
  - unzipping, edit files (e.g., renaming) and zipping again -> .zip file is not recognised as ImageJ-roi file

- Installation of sample dataset fails ([#22](https://github.com/Defense-Circuits-Lab/findmycells/issues/22))

- Setting a slider range in preprocessing step causes fail in segmentation step ([#21](https://github.com/Defense-Circuits-Lab/findmycells/issues/21))

- Migrate projects between computers ([#19](https://github.com/Defense-Circuits-Lab/findmycells/issues/19))
  - saving and loading projects does not work after migration of project to different computer
