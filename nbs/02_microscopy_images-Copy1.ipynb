    "Imaging softwares, especially proprietary ones, produce a vast variety of filetypes. Likewise, you can also have your region-of-interest annotations in various different formats. This module is here to help you get all your data properly read, while the actual interface to the remaining modules, i.e. the `DataLoader`s can be found in the \"data_loaders\" module. This makes it easy to add more `DataReader` subclasses for additional input formats, while the `DataLoader` classes donÂ´t have to be adjusted. For this to work the `DataReader` subclasses have to define what filetype extension they can read. This will be done via the `.readable_filetype_extensions` attribute as described below."
